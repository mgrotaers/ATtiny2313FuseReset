# ATtiny2313 High Voltage Parallel Programming Fuse Reset

At moment this is starting the framework for developing the arduino code.
NOTE, SOME CODE IS UNTESTED.



The development of this project was created to unlock a ATtiny2313 chip.

Inspiration from searching the internet came from the following sources.  All circuits and code have been derived from these sources:
  - http://www.rickety.us/2010/03/arduino-avr-high-voltage-serial-programmer/
  - https://sites.google.com/site/wayneholder/attiny-fuse-reset
  - https://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/09/arduino-based-avr-high-voltage-programmer/
  - http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2543-AVR-ATtiny2313_Datasheet.pdf

Since the ATtiny2313 uses parallel high voltage programming Jeff Keyzer's article code was the most useful.  By understanding code 
from mightyohm.com and using the Atmel ATtiny2313A/4313 data sheet page 184-199 this code was able to be developed.
